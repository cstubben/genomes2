\details{ This file was created by selecting complete microbial genomes with publications in 
the \code{\link{lproks}} table and then downloading the citations using \code{\link{ncbiPubmed}}.
 The 113 genomes with two or more listed publications were checked to 
 identify the likely genome paper from the list of comma-separated pubmed IDs (the genome paper 
 was the first pubmed id in 75 of the 113 projects).   The published date was added by formatting 
 the pubdate column, except for 237 papers with only a year listed - in these cases the artdate 
 column was used.
